## Introduction

This project is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of machine learning using Python. It includes examples of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Setup

To run this project, you will need to set up your environment with the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Data Exploration

In this section, we explore the dataset used in this project. We load the data, perform basic statistical analysis, and visualize key features to understand the data better.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing or standardizing numerical features
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Model Training

We train various machine learning models on the preprocessed data. The models include:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Model Evaluation

After training the models, we evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Conclusion

The notebook concludes with a summary of the findings and potential next steps for further improving the models or exploring other machine learning techniques.

## Usage

To run this notebook, simply open it in Google Colab and follow the steps outlined in each section. Make sure to install the necessary libraries if they are not already available in your environment.
